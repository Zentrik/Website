	abstract = {Aerodynamic forces are not negligible for a reusable rocket returning back to Earth. How the aerodynamic controls and propulsion should be coordinated to realize fuel-optimal precise landing is addressed in this paper. To this end, a model-based optimal control problem is formulated with the rocket’s angle of attack and thrust as control inputs, and constraints on the controls are included to reflect the capabilities of the vehicle. Precise landing requires the (highly nonlinear and nonconvex) problem to be solved onboard in real time. This ability of online computation is becoming increasingly desired in aerospace guidance and control for autonomous missions. Hence, this paper presents how to solve the rocket landing problem via convex optimization that has guaranteed polynomial-time complexity. Specifically, a novel methodology of handling the rocket nonlinear dynamics is introduced, and a relaxation technique used to convexify nonconvex constraints is theoretically proved to be valid. High efficiency of the proposed method, with potential for online computation, is demonstrated by numerical examples and comparisons with other methods.},

	abstract = {Planetary soft landing is one of the benchmark problems of optimal control theory and is gaining renewed interest due to the increased focus on the exploration of planets in the solar system, such as Mars. The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states. The main difficulty in solving this constrained problem is the existence of nonconvex constraints on the control input, which are due to a nonzero lower bound on the control input magnitude and a nonconvex constraint on its direction. This paper introduces a convexification of the control constraints that is proven to be lossless; i.e., an optimal solution of the soft landing problem can be obtained via solution of the proposed convex relaxation of the problem. The lossless convexification enables the use of interior point methods of convex optimization to obtain optimal solutions of the original nonconvex optimal control problem.

	doi = {10.2514/1.47202},
	abstract = {To increase the science return of future missions to Mars and to enable sample return missions, the accuracy with which a lander can be delivered to the Martian surface must be improved by orders of magnitude. The prior work developed a convex-optimization-based minimum-fuel powered-descent guidance algorithm. In this paper, this convex-optimization-based approach is extended to handle the case when no feasible trajectory to the target exists. In this case, the objective is to generate the minimum-landing-error trajectory, which is the trajectory that minimizes the distance to the prescribed target while using the available fuel optimally. This problem is inherently a nonconvex optimal control problem due to a nonzero lower bound on the magnitude of the feasible thrust vector. It is first proven that an optimal solution of a convex relaxation of the problem is also optimal for the original nonconvex problem, which is referred to as a lossless convexification of the original nonconvex problem. Then it is shown that the minimum-landing-error trajectory generation problem can be posed as a convex optimization problem and solved to global optimality with known bounds on convergence time. This makes the approach amenable to onboard implementation for real-time applications.

	title = {Enhancements on the Convex Programming Based Powered Descent Guidance Algorithm for Mars Landing},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present enhancements on the powered descent guidance algorithm developed for Mars pinpoint landing. The guidance algorithm solves the powered descent minimum fuel trajectory optimization problem via a direct numerical method. Our main contribution is to formulate the trajectory optimization problem, which has nonconvex control constraints, as a finite dimensional convex optimization problem, specifically as a finite dimensional second order cone programming ({SOCP}) problem. {SOCP} is a subclass of convex programming, and there are efficient {SOCP} solvers with deterministic convergence properties. Hence, the resulting guidance algorithm can potentially be implemented onboard a spacecraft for real-time applications. Particularly, this paper discusses the algorithmic improvements obtained by: (i) Using an efficient approach to choose the optimal time-of-flight; (ii) Using a computationally inexpensive way to detect the fea-sibility/infeasibility of the problem due to the thrust-to-weight constraint; (iii) Incorporating the rotation rate of the planet into the problem formulation; (iv) Developing additional constraints on the position and velocity to guarantee no-subsurface flight between the time samples of the temporal discretization; (v) Developing a fuel-limited targeting algorithm; (vi) Initial result on developing an onboard table lookup method to obtain almost fuel optimal solutions in real-time.},

	title = {Successive Convexification for 6-{DoF} Mars Rocket Powered Landing with Free-Final-Time},
	abstract = {In this paper, we employ successive convexification to solve the minimum-time 6-{DoF} rocket powered landing problem. The contribution of this paper is the development and demonstration of a free-final-time problem formulation that can be solved iteratively using a successive convexification framework. This paper is an extension of our previous work on the 3-{DoF} free-final-time and the 6-{DoF} fixed-final-time minimum-fuel problems. Herein, the vehicle is modeled as a 6-{DoF} rigid-body controlled by a single gimbaled rocket engine. The trajectory is subject to a variety of convex and non-convex state-and control-constraints, and aerodynamic effects are assumed negligible. The objective of the problem is to determine the optimal thrust commands that will minimize the time-of-flight while satisfying the aforementioned constraints. Solving this problem quickly and reliably is challenging because (a) it is nonlinear and non-convex, (b) the validity of the solution is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the discretization scheme, and (c) it can be difficult to select a suitable reference trajectory to initialize an iterative solution process. To deal with these issues, our algorithm (a) uses successive convexification to eliminate non-convexities, (b) computes the discrete linear-time-variant system matrices to ensure that the converged solution perfectly satisfies the original nonlinear dynamics, and (c) can be initialized with a simple, dynamically inconsistent reference trajectory. Using the proposed convex formulation and successive convexification framework, we are able to convert the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex second-order cone programming ({SOCP}) sub-problems. Through the use of Interior Point Method ({IPM}) solvers, this sequence can be solved quickly and reliably, thus enabling higher fidelity real-time guidance for rocket powered landings on Mars.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the {SCvx} algorithm, a successive convexification algorithm designed to solve non-convex constrained optimal control problems with global convergence and su-perlinear convergence-rate guarantees. The proposed algorithm can handle nonlinear dynamics and non-convex state and control constraints. It solves the original problem to optimality by successively linearizing non-convex dynamics and constraints about the solution of the previous iteration. The resulting convex subproblems are numerically tractable, and can be computed quickly and reliably using convex optimization solvers, making the {SCvx} algorithm well suited for real-time applications. Analysis is presented to show that the algorithm converges both globally and superlinearly, guaranteeing i) local optimality recovery: if the converged solution is feasible with respect to the original problem, then it is also a local optimum; ii) strong convergence: if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz ({KL}) inequality holds at the converged solution, then the solution is unique. The superlinear rate of convergence is obtained by exploiting the structure of optimal control problems, showcasing that faster rate of convergence can be achieved by leveraging specific problem properties when compared to generic nonlinear programming methods. Numerical simulations are performed for a non-convex quad-rotor motion planning problem, and corresponding results obtained using Sequential Quadratic Programming ({SQP}) and general purpose Interior Point Method ({IPM}) solvers are provided for comparison. The results show that the convergence rate of the {SCvx} algorithm is indeed superlinear, and that {SCvx} outperforms the other two methods by converging in less number of iterations.},

This problem presents a challenge for real-time guidance applications due to its non-convex control constraints, and nonlinearities introduced by drag, massdepletion dynamics, and free final time. To make the problem tractable, we employ lossless convexification to address the minimum-thrust constraint, and successive convexification to eliminate the remaining non-convexities. The latter constitutes the main contribution of this paper, and relies on the use of linearization, trust regions, and relaxations to formulate the problem as a sequence of iteratively solved second-order cone programming ({SOCP}) problems. In this form, we are able to implement our algorithm using powerful Interior Point Method ({IPM}) solvers, ideal for use in real-time applications. Furthermore, the only initialization parameter our algorithm requires is a coarse guess of the time of flight. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed successive convexification algorithm converges reliably after only a small number of successive convexification iterations. Additionally, we show that the algorithm is robust to a wide range of time of flight inputs, thus making it suitable for autonomous real-time applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a successive convexification guidance algorithm for the 6-{DoF} fixed-final-time fuel-optimal Mars powered descent landing problem. We assume that the vehicle is actuated by a single gimbaled rocket motor with lower and upper thrust bounds, and that aerodynamic forces are negligible. Solving this problem in real-time is challenging for three reasons. First, it is non-convex due to its thrust-magnitude lower bound, mass- depletion dynamics, and attitude dynamics. Second, the consistency of attitude transformations is highly dependent on the magnitude of the attitude quaternion, thus making discretization accuracy crucial. Third, the initialization of an iterative process can be challenging since a suitable reference trajectory may not be readily available. Our algorithm addresses these issues in the following ways. First, we employ successive convexification to handle non-convexities, and avoid chatter in the control variables by decoupling the states and controls. Second, we compute the linearized system's state and control matrices to ensure that upon convergence, the nonlinear dynamics are satisfied. Lastly, we show that our algorithm can converge even when initialized with a very simple, dynamically inconsistent reference trajectory. Using the aforementioned techniques, our algorithm converts the original problem into a sequence of second-order cone programming ({SOCP}) problems that can be solved quickly and reliably using Interior Point Method ({IPM}) algorithms suitable for real-time autonomous applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I present a summary and implementations of work done in convex programming approaches [1][2][3][4] to the fuel-optimal powered descent, or "soft-landing", problem. These trajectory optimization problems are nontrivial due to nonconvex control restraints and will be formulated as a finite-dimensional second-order cone program ({SOCP}). {SOCPs} are a convex program subclass with efficient solvers that have deterministic convergence properties. I will initially pose and solve a single trajectory optimization program with a time-of-flight search and then explore a successive approach. The successive approach, with nonlinearities, mass-depletion dynamics, and free final time presents a challenge for real-time implementation. To provide a tractable solution we must employ a methods of lossless convexification, linearization, trust regions, and relaxations. Again formulating the problem as an {SOCP} and initialized with a coarse time-of-flight estimation, it can be solved iteratively, hence successive. These algorithms can be implemented on autonomous real-time systems with powerful modern Interior Point Method ({IPM}) solvers.
